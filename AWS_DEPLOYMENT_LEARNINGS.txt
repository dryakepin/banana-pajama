BANANA PAJAMA ZOMBIE SHOOTER - AWS DEPLOYMENT LEARNINGS
=========================================================

Date: 2025-08-09
Project: Banana Pajama Zombie Shooter Game
Deployment Target: AWS ECS Fargate with RDS PostgreSQL

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY ISSUE
==========================================

Problem: ARM64 vs AMD64 Architecture Mismatch
- Docker images built on Apple Silicon (ARM64) cannot run on AWS Fargate (AMD64)
- Error: "exec /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error"
- Solution: Build all Docker images with --platform linux/amd64 flag

Key Learning: Always specify target platform when building for cloud deployment:
```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t image-name .
```

CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION LESSONS
===============================

1. Network Mode Considerations in ECS Fargate
   - awsvpc mode: All containers in same task share network interface
   - Containers communicate via localhost, not service names
   - Service discovery works differently than Docker Compose

2. Task Definition Evolution
   - Started with 3-container setup (nginx proxy + client + server)
   - Simplified to 2-container setup (client nginx + server)
   - Client nginx handles both static serving and API proxying

3. Container Dependencies and Health Checks
   - Use dependsOn with HEALTHY condition for proper startup order
   - Health check grace periods are crucial for container startup time
   - startPeriod should account for application initialization

SECRETS MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES
==================================

1. AWS Secrets Manager Integration
   - Never hardcode credentials in task definitions
   - Use secrets parameter instead of environment for sensitive data
   - Required IAM permissions for ECS execution role to access secrets

2. Database Password Management
   - RDS master password can be modified via aws rds modify-db-instance
   - Password changes require waiting for instance to become available
   - Secrets Manager should be updated to match RDS configuration

LOAD BALANCER AND SERVICE DISCOVERY
===================================

1. ECS Service Load Balancer Configuration
   - Load balancer must be configured during service update
   - Specify correct containerName and containerPort in load balancer config
   - Health check grace period prevents premature target deregistration

2. Target Group Health Monitoring
   - Targets must pass health checks before receiving traffic
   - Monitor target health with aws elbv2 describe-target-health
   - 503 errors indicate no healthy targets in target group

DATABASE CONNECTIVITY CHALLENGES
=================================

1. Connection Authentication Issues
   - PostgreSQL error code 28P01 indicates authentication failure
   - Verify credentials match between RDS instance and application configuration
   - Test database connectivity before deploying containers

2. Connection Configuration
   - Use environment variables for database connection parameters
   - Implement proper connection pooling and error handling
   - Database host should use RDS endpoint, not localhost

DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE OPTIMIZATIONS
==================================

1. Image Build and Push Workflow
   - Separate build and push scripts for better modularity
   - Use ECR for container registry with proper authentication
   - Tag images consistently and push after successful builds

2. Task Definition Versioning
   - Each task definition update creates new revision
   - Services can be updated to use specific task definition versions
   - Keep track of working configurations for rollback scenarios

MONITORING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================

1. CloudWatch Logs Analysis
   - Container logs available in /ecs/[project]-[environment]-[container]
   - Use log stream names to identify specific task instances
   - Filter logs by time range for efficient troubleshooting

2. ECS Service Events
   - Service events provide deployment status and error information
   - Task failure reasons help identify configuration issues
   - Monitor service deployments with aws ecs describe-services

INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE LESSONS
===============================

1. CloudFormation Stack Dependencies
   - Organize stacks by resource type (VPC, RDS, ECS)
   - Use stack outputs and imports for resource references
   - Consider stack update compatibility when making changes

2. Resource Naming Conventions
   - Use consistent naming: [project]-[environment]-[resource-type]
   - Include environment in all resource names for clarity
   - Use descriptive names for troubleshooting efficiency

PERFORMANCE AND SCALING CONSIDERATIONS
======================================

1. Container Resource Allocation
   - Start with minimal CPU/memory and scale based on monitoring
   - 512 CPU / 1024 MB memory worked well for this game
   - Monitor container utilization in CloudWatch

2. Auto-scaling Configuration
   - ECS services support auto-scaling based on various metrics
   - Consider implementing scaling policies for production workloads
   - Load balancer handles traffic distribution across tasks

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED
===================================

1. IAM Roles and Permissions
   - Separate execution role and task role for ECS
   - Grant minimal required permissions for secrets access
   - Use AWS managed policies where appropriate

2. Network Security
   - VPC with public/private subnet architecture
   - Security groups restrict access to necessary ports only
   - RDS in private subnets accessible only from ECS tasks

COST OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS
===========================

1. Fargate vs EC2 Trade-offs
   - Fargate eliminates server management overhead
   - Higher per-task cost but lower operational complexity
   - Suitable for variable workloads and development environments

2. Resource Right-sizing
   - Monitor actual resource usage to optimize task definitions
   - RDS t3.micro sufficient for development/testing workloads
   - Consider reserved instances for consistent workloads

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS
==================================

1. Local Development Environment
   - Docker Compose for local development maintains service discovery
   - Environment-specific configurations for local vs AWS deployment
   - Consistent development and production container images

2. Deployment Automation
   - Shell scripts automate build, push, and deployment processes
   - Error handling and validation in deployment scripts
   - Version tracking through task definition revisions

DATABASE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES (HIGH SCORE SYSTEM FIX)
========================================================

Date: 2025-08-17
Issue: High score system was using mock responses instead of real database

CRITICAL DATABASE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES DISCOVERED
==============================================

1. VPC Networking Mismatch
   - Problem: ECS tasks deployed in different VPC than RDS database
   - Original ECS VPC: vpc-005733126e9495e5d 
   - Database VPC: vpc-0ec7abc587f0a440c
   - Error: "connect ETIMEDOUT" when trying to reach database
   - Solution: Update ECS service network configuration to use database VPC subnets

2. Security Group Configuration
   - Database security group (sg-08049cb917e36878c) properly allowed ECS security group access
   - ECS security group (sg-090a1f8f47a22bcd6) needed to be used by tasks
   - Port 5432 access configured correctly between security groups

3. Database Authentication Issues  
   - Error: Password mismatch between AWS Secrets Manager and RDS instance
   - Solution: Reset RDS master password to match secrets configuration
   - Command: aws rds modify-db-instance --master-user-password "ZombieShooter#Game123"

DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION
================================

Phase 1: Frontend-Only Deployment (Broken State)
- Client container with nginx serving static files
- Nginx configured with mock API responses
- No backend server container deployed
- Database existed but was unused

Phase 2: Full-Stack Deployment (Working State)  
- Multi-container task definition with client + server
- Server container: Node.js Express API with PostgreSQL connectivity
- Client container: nginx with API proxy to localhost:3000
- Database: Real PostgreSQL with persistent high scores

MULTI-CONTAINER TASK NETWORKING LESSONS
=======================================

1. Container Communication in ECS Fargate
   - All containers in same task share network namespace
   - Inter-container communication uses localhost, not service names
   - nginx proxy configuration: proxy_pass http://localhost:3000 (not http://server:3000)

2. Network Configuration Updates
   - ECS service network configuration doesn't apply to running tasks immediately
   - Must force new task creation to apply network changes
   - Methods: Scale to 0 then back to 1, or update task definition

DATABASE INITIALIZATION PATTERNS
===============================

1. Database Schema Management
   - Created API endpoint `/api/init-db` for schema initialization
   - Handles CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS for idempotent operations
   - Includes sample data insertion for testing
   - Better than external migration tools for simple deployments

2. Production Database Setup
   - Use environment variables from AWS Secrets Manager
   - Implement proper connection pooling with pg Pool
   - SSL configuration for production environments  
   - Health check endpoint to verify database connectivity

TROUBLESHOOTING METHODOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS
=======================================

1. Log Analysis Strategy
   - Check CloudWatch logs for both container start and runtime errors
   - Database connection errors appear after health check attempts
   - Use task ID to correlate logs with specific deployments

2. Network Troubleshooting Steps
   - Verify VPC and subnet configuration of ECS tasks
   - Check security group ingress/egress rules
   - Confirm database endpoint accessibility from task subnets
   - Test database credentials separately from application

3. Service Deployment Validation
   - Monitor ECS service events for deployment status
   - Check task health status and container health checks
   - Verify task network interface details match expected configuration

SECRETS MANAGEMENT ENHANCED PRACTICES
====================================

1. Database Credential Synchronization
   - Ensure Secrets Manager values match RDS instance configuration
   - Update both RDS password and secrets when making changes
   - Test connectivity after any credential modifications

2. Multi-Secret Management
   - Database secrets: host, port, username, password, database name
   - Application secrets: session secrets, CORS origins
   - Separate secret stores for different concern areas

API TESTING AND VALIDATION PROCEDURES
====================================

1. End-to-End High Score Testing
   - GET /api/highscores - Verify data retrieval
   - POST /api/highscores - Test score submission
   - Validate ranking calculations and data persistence
   - Test with various score values and player names

2. Health Check Validation
   - /api/health - Basic server status
   - /api/health with database - Full system health including DB connectivity
   - Health checks should return meaningful error information

INFRASTRUCTURE COST CONSIDERATIONS
=================================

1. Multi-Container Task Costs
   - Two containers in single task share CPU/memory allocation
   - More cost-effective than separate ECS services
   - 512 CPU / 1024 MB memory adequate for game + API

2. Database Sizing
   - t3.micro sufficient for development and light production
   - PostgreSQL on RDS provides managed backups and maintenance
   - Consider connection limits for scaling requirements

FINAL WORKING ARCHITECTURE (POST-FIX)
====================================

Current Configuration:
- Multi-container ECS task in correct VPC (vpc-0ec7abc587f0a440c)
- Client Container: nginx serving game + proxying API calls (port 80)
- Server Container: Node.js Express API with real PostgreSQL (port 3000)  
- Database: AWS RDS PostgreSQL with working authentication
- Network: Both containers in same task, communicate via localhost
- Security: Proper security group configuration for database access

Key Success Factors:
1. Correct VPC networking configuration
2. Multi-container task with proper inter-container communication
3. Real database integration with persistent storage
4. Working authentication between application and database
5. API endpoints fully functional for game integration

High Score System Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
