BANANA PAJAMA ZOMBIE SHOOTER - AWS DEPLOYMENT LEARNINGS
=========================================================

Date: 2025-08-09
Project: Banana Pajama Zombie Shooter Game
Deployment Target: AWS ECS Fargate with RDS PostgreSQL

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY ISSUE
==========================================

Problem: ARM64 vs AMD64 Architecture Mismatch
- Docker images built on Apple Silicon (ARM64) cannot run on AWS Fargate (AMD64)
- Error: "exec /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error"
- Solution: Build all Docker images with --platform linux/amd64 flag

Key Learning: Always specify target platform when building for cloud deployment:
```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t image-name .
```

CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION LESSONS
===============================

1. Network Mode Considerations in ECS Fargate
   - awsvpc mode: All containers in same task share network interface
   - Containers communicate via localhost, not service names
   - Service discovery works differently than Docker Compose

2. Task Definition Evolution
   - Started with 3-container setup (nginx proxy + client + server)
   - Simplified to 2-container setup (client nginx + server)
   - Client nginx handles both static serving and API proxying

3. Container Dependencies and Health Checks
   - Use dependsOn with HEALTHY condition for proper startup order
   - Health check grace periods are crucial for container startup time
   - startPeriod should account for application initialization

SECRETS MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES
==================================

1. AWS Secrets Manager Integration
   - Never hardcode credentials in task definitions
   - Use secrets parameter instead of environment for sensitive data
   - Required IAM permissions for ECS execution role to access secrets

2. Database Password Management
   - RDS master password can be modified via aws rds modify-db-instance
   - Password changes require waiting for instance to become available
   - Secrets Manager should be updated to match RDS configuration

LOAD BALANCER AND SERVICE DISCOVERY
===================================

1. ECS Service Load Balancer Configuration
   - Load balancer must be configured during service update
   - Specify correct containerName and containerPort in load balancer config
   - Health check grace period prevents premature target deregistration

2. Target Group Health Monitoring
   - Targets must pass health checks before receiving traffic
   - Monitor target health with aws elbv2 describe-target-health
   - 503 errors indicate no healthy targets in target group

DATABASE CONNECTIVITY CHALLENGES
=================================

1. Connection Authentication Issues
   - PostgreSQL error code 28P01 indicates authentication failure
   - Verify credentials match between RDS instance and application configuration
   - Test database connectivity before deploying containers

2. Connection Configuration
   - Use environment variables for database connection parameters
   - Implement proper connection pooling and error handling
   - Database host should use RDS endpoint, not localhost

DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE OPTIMIZATIONS
==================================

1. Image Build and Push Workflow
   - Separate build and push scripts for better modularity
   - Use ECR for container registry with proper authentication
   - Tag images consistently and push after successful builds

2. Task Definition Versioning
   - Each task definition update creates new revision
   - Services can be updated to use specific task definition versions
   - Keep track of working configurations for rollback scenarios

MONITORING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================

1. CloudWatch Logs Analysis
   - Container logs available in /ecs/[project]-[environment]-[container]
   - Use log stream names to identify specific task instances
   - Filter logs by time range for efficient troubleshooting

2. ECS Service Events
   - Service events provide deployment status and error information
   - Task failure reasons help identify configuration issues
   - Monitor service deployments with aws ecs describe-services

INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE LESSONS
===============================

1. CloudFormation Stack Dependencies
   - Organize stacks by resource type (VPC, RDS, ECS)
   - Use stack outputs and imports for resource references
   - Consider stack update compatibility when making changes

2. Resource Naming Conventions
   - Use consistent naming: [project]-[environment]-[resource-type]
   - Include environment in all resource names for clarity
   - Use descriptive names for troubleshooting efficiency

PERFORMANCE AND SCALING CONSIDERATIONS
======================================

1. Container Resource Allocation
   - Start with minimal CPU/memory and scale based on monitoring
   - 512 CPU / 1024 MB memory worked well for this game
   - Monitor container utilization in CloudWatch

2. Auto-scaling Configuration
   - ECS services support auto-scaling based on various metrics
   - Consider implementing scaling policies for production workloads
   - Load balancer handles traffic distribution across tasks

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED
===================================

1. IAM Roles and Permissions
   - Separate execution role and task role for ECS
   - Grant minimal required permissions for secrets access
   - Use AWS managed policies where appropriate

2. Network Security
   - VPC with public/private subnet architecture
   - Security groups restrict access to necessary ports only
   - RDS in private subnets accessible only from ECS tasks

COST OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS
===========================

1. Fargate vs EC2 Trade-offs
   - Fargate eliminates server management overhead
   - Higher per-task cost but lower operational complexity
   - Suitable for variable workloads and development environments

2. Resource Right-sizing
   - Monitor actual resource usage to optimize task definitions
   - RDS t3.micro sufficient for development/testing workloads
   - Consider reserved instances for consistent workloads

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS
==================================

1. Local Development Environment
   - Docker Compose for local development maintains service discovery
   - Environment-specific configurations for local vs AWS deployment
   - Consistent development and production container images

2. Deployment Automation
   - Shell scripts automate build, push, and deployment processes
   - Error handling and validation in deployment scripts
   - Version tracking through task definition revisions

FINAL ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY
===========================

Working Configuration:
- Client Container: nginx serving static files + API proxy (port 80)
- Server Container: Node.js Express API with database connectivity (port 3000)
- Database: AWS RDS PostgreSQL with Secrets Manager credentials
- Load Balancer: ALB routing to client container port 80
- Network: awsvpc mode with containers sharing localhost communication

Key Success Factors:
1. Correct platform architecture (linux/amd64)
2. Proper secrets management via AWS Secrets Manager
3. Simplified container architecture with nginx proxy in client
4. Health checks and proper startup dependencies
5. Load balancer integration with ECS service

Total Deployment Time: ~3 hours (including troubleshooting)
Final Status: âœ… SUCCESSFUL - Game fully operational and accessible

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEPLOYMENTS
======================================

1. Always use --platform linux/amd64 for AWS Fargate deployments
2. Start with simplified container architecture before adding complexity
3. Implement comprehensive health checks and monitoring from the start
4. Use AWS Secrets Manager for all sensitive configuration
5. Test load balancer integration early in the deployment process
6. Maintain separate configurations for development and production environments
7. Document working configurations for quick reference and rollbacks
8. Implement proper CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments
9. Monitor costs and optimize resource allocation based on actual usage
10. Keep infrastructure as code for reproducible deployments
